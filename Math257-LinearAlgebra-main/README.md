## Details of Labs

These labs test and utilize our knowledge of Linear Algebra and apply them to practical problems using python through Jupyter Notebooks. The labs towards the end of the semester are definitely a lot more interesting especially the use of **Principal Component Analysis** for data compression as well as using **Linear Regression** to predict weather.
