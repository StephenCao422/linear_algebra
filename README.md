# MATH257
## Linear Algebra with Computational Applications
### This is a first course in linear algebra. This covers basic definitions and algorithms of the subject needed in the higher level (engineering, science and economics) courses and more sophisticated mathematical techniques such as the Singular Value Decomposition. In this course you learn the mathematical theory and how to implement it in Python. You will discover many of the striking modern applications of linear algebra, such as Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm, image and audio compression schemes such as JPEG and MP3, automatic face recognition and other data science and machine learning algorithms. The course covers the same mathematical theory as MATH 415, but adds a focus on the computational and large data aspect of linear algebra through the lab sessions.
